# InnoGames OpenFL

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/innogames/openfl.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/innogames/openfl)

This repository contains a fork of the great [OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl/openfl) framework that we at [InnoGames](https://www.innogames.com) use to power our HTML5 games.

Originally it's based on version 7.1.1, but was heavily reworked and stripped down since then. We contributed a large part of the fixes we made to the original version, however because both the upstream version and our fork were changed a lot over the time, the codebases are no longer compatible.

We would like to have more freedom to change the code structure to meet the needs of our projects, hence we'll be maintaining this fork as a separate project.
